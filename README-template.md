## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Transitions
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query to aid good responsiveness on the web
- JavaScript (Dom Manipulation)
- CSS Animations.


### What I learned

I learnt how to use SVG files; how to adjust their aspect ratio with viewbox. Also i developed more skills with media queries.
i had the chance to improve my skills with CSS animations.


### Continued development

I would like to take further lessons on grid layouts, because i am more comfortable with flex. Then also continue my JavaScript lessons.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.W3Schools.com) - This helped me to remember concepts i somehow forgot.
